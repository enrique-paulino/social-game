Main Layout of the Game
	
	Key variables required:
	
		playerRole 		-	the role assigned to each player
							"GAMEMASTER"
							"TRAITOR"
							"PLAYER"
		playerStatus	-	the status of each player
							"ALIVE"
							"LASTLIFE"
							"DEAD"
		playerCount		-	for the selection of a minigame 
							"ODD"
							"EVEN"
		playerNumber	-	number of players currently who aren't "DEAD"
		roundNo			- 	increases per round until a maximum is hit or a win condition is met
		
		
	Pseudocode: 
	
		Begin when host in lobby presses start button
			start button has timer incase they want to cancel
			IF timer gets to 0
				start this code 

		Assign playerRole to every player WHERE
			one player is "GAMEMASTER"
			IF playerCount > ---:
				one player is "TRAITOR"
			rest of players are "PLAYER"
			
		Assign everyone's playerStatus to "ALIVE"
	
		Set the variable roundNo to 0
	
	
		Here would be the start of the loop of the game until a win condition has been met
	
		
		Increase roundNo by 1
		
		Calculate the values playerCount and playerNumber
			assign the playerCount to the number of players who aren't "GAMEMASTER"
			using playerCount:
				IF mod playerCount is 0
					playerNumber is "EVEN"
				ELSE
					playerNumber is "ODD"
		
		Using a seperate file "Minigame Characteristics"
			call ONE minigame that fits the current game characteristics:
				give: playerCount, playerNumber and roundNo
				return: minigameName
				
		Using minigameName
			call the seperate file for the corresponding minigame
			run the minigame providing player characteristics:
				give: playerRole and playerStatus
				return: updated playerStatus if necessary
				
		Check if any win conditions have been met
			IF one has
				display the appropriate win screen
				return players back to the lobby
				end this code
			ELSE
				repeat this loop
				
				
	Possible Win Conditions:
		
		At any point throughout the game
			IF playerRole "TRAITOR" is playerStatus "ALIVE"
				IF playerCount <= 2 
					"GAMEMASTER" and "TRAITOR" win
			ELSE IF playerCount < 0
				"GAMEMASTER" and "TRAITOR" win
		
		IF roundNo = maximum round number
			IF playerRole "TRAITOR" is playerStatus "ALIVE"
				IF playerCount > 2
					"PLAYER" wins
			ELSE IF playerCount > 0
				"PLAYER" wins 
			ELSE
				"GAMEMASTER" and "TRAITOR" win
