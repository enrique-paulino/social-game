Minigame Characteristics

	Game conditions:
	
		minigameName	-	name of the minigame 
		playerCount 	-	the maximum players for this game
		playerNumber	- 	whether the game is better for an odd or even player count (or neither)
		roundNo 		- 	minimum round required to play this game
	
	Pseudocode:
	
		From main layout of the game code, this file gives us:
			playerCount, playerNumber and roundNo 
		
		Create an empty array possibleMinigames
		
		Using these values, gather the variable minigameName into the array possibleMinigames of the minigames which satisfy these variables
			data for minigame characteristics could be stored like this and sorted through:
				[minigameName, playerCount, playerNumber, roundNo]
			or it could be stored in a more appropriate method 
				
		IF possibleMinigames has more than 1 value in it
			randomly select one of these minigames 
			
		return the minigameName back to the main layout of the game code
